    <br />
    <p class="ex3">
      LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is used to determine distance by measuring how long it takes light to reach an object and reflect back. The custom-designed LiDAR Scanner uses direct time-of-flight to measure reflected light from up to 5
      metres away, both indoors and out and opens up tremendous possibilities for augmented reality and beyond.

    <br />
    <p class="ex3">
      On the new iPad Pro, AR apps become even more realistic. Realistic object occlusion allows AR objects to pass in front of and behind real-world structures. Improved motion capture and people occlusion are more accurate than ever.
