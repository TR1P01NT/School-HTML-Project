      It just got a whole lot harder to take a bad photo.

    <p class="ex2">
      All‑new dual‑camera system. Take your photos from wide to ultra‑wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do
      photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective.

      Take your video up a notch with<br />
      edits down to the last detail.
    </p>
    <p class="ex2">
      Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures 4x more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your friend catching a
      frisbee. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos.

      <b>New Ultra Wide camera.</b> Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures 4x more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And holiday shots that show the whole family —
      including the views you travelled 18,000 kilometres for.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="ex4">
      <b>Introducing Night mode.</b> Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‑light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colours are more natural
      and photos are brighter.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="ex4">
      <b>Take portraits to new places.</b> With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes
      your best friends, two‑legged or four.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="ex4">
      <b>Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake.</b> Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to
      automatically track a moving subject.

      Smart HDR
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="ex4">
      <b>Next‑generation Smart HDR.</b> Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognises people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows and natural‑looking
      skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous.

      <b>Introducing the slofie.</b> Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera.
      Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.
