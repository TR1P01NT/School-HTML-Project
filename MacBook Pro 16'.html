      Retina Display
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The new MacBook Pro features a stunning 16-inch Retina display — the largest Retina display ever in a Mac notebook. It produces 500 nits of brightness for spectacular highlights and bright whites, while delivering deep blacks thanks to the precise photo alignment of liquid crystal molecules. And the P3 wide colour gamut enables brilliant, true-to-life images and videos.

      Processor and Memory
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The 16-inch MacBook Pro brings a whole new class of performance to the notebook. Thanks to a more advanced thermal design and the Intel Core i9 processor with up to 8 cores and 16 threads of processing power. So whether you’re layering dozens of tracks and effects, rendering 3D models or compiling and testing code, you’ll be doing it in no time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="ex3">
      <b>More advanced thermal architecture enables faster processing.</b> The thermal architecture in MacBook Pro has been completely redesigned, featuring larger impellers with improved fan blades for optimal airflow and more heat-dispersing fins for more effective cooling. The resulting gain in cooling capacity allows MacBook Pro to deliver up to 12 watts more maximum sustained power.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="ex3">
      <b>Up to 64GB of DDR4 memory means more efficient multitasking.</b> The 16-inch MacBook Pro uses fast 2666MHz DDR4 memory — up to 64GB — for smooth performance whether you’re loading hundreds of audio samples, editing billion-pixel images or running multiple virtual machines.
    </p>

      Graphics
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series delivers the most graphics horsepower ever in a MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro base model is over two times faster than the previous-generation base model, for seamless playback and faster rendering of ultra-high-definition video. And with the optional 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, you’ll get up to 80 per cent faster performance when executing tasks like colour grading in DaVinci Resolve.
    </p>

    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Keyboard
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The 16-inch MacBook Pro takes workflow efficiency to a new level. The new Magic Keyboard features a refined scissor mechanism with 1 millimetre of travel for a responsive, comfortable and quiet typing experience. The Touch Bar puts powerful shortcuts front and centre, and Touch ID provides fast authentication. A dedicated Escape key allows quick switching between modes and views.

  <div>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Audio
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      MacBook Pro has a big voice. The six-speaker sound system produces room-filling wide stereo sound. Dual force-cancelling woofers dramatically reduce system vibration for a clearer, more natural sound. And the studio-quality three-mic array rivals professional third‑party microphones, for creating truly clean podcasts or music recordings on the go.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Storage
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The 16-inch MacBook Pro has up to 8TB of SSD storage. So you can take your photo or video libraries with you no matter where you’re headed. And with super-fast speeds, massive files load in an instant and pro apps launch in a blink.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Battery
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      The 16-inch MacBook Pro has 100-watt-hour lithium‑polymer battery  that not only powers the larger display and delivers higher maximum sustained power, it also provides longer battery life — up to 11 hours of wireless web browsing and video playback.
    </p>

  <div>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Apple T2 Security Chip
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      Every MacBook Pro is equipped with the Apple T2 Security Chip designed to make everything you do even more secure. It includes a Secure Enclave coprocessor that powers Touch ID and provides the foundation for secure boot and encrypted storage capabilities. It also consolidates many discrete controllers, including the system management controller, audio controller and SSD controller, into one.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p align="center" style="font-size:35pt">
      Thunderbolt 3
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
      Thunderbolt 3 combines ultra‑high bandwidth with the ultra‑versatility of the USB‑C industry standard to create one revved‑up universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging and video output in a single connector, delivering up to 40 Gbps of throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. And Thunderbolt 3 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in, it’s always right side up.
